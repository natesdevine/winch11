# Operating Systems PCB Simulator

An operating systems process control block simulator including four process scheduling algorithms (round robin, shortest process next, first come first serve, and shortest remaining time) as well as memory assignment algorithms including compaction functionality. 
Submitted as a final course project for COM 326: Operating Systems at Connecticut College, Fall 2018.

To use the simulator simply run control.py using Python 3.
