This screenshot shows the ability of our code to add new processes from user interface. As can be seen in the screenshot, only a process with a non-redundant ID can be created, and type checks are performed on each user-inputted parameter to ensure their validity. Further evident in the screenshot is the newly inputted user process being added to correct location in the process queue with respect to process priority.
