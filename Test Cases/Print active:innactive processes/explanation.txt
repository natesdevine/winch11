This screenshot demonstrates the ability of our code to print out active/nonactive processes. A processes activity state is determined by the second of the comma separated values in the provided .txt file. Accordingly, processes 2446 and 2546 are printed as active because they had an active value of True, while process 7481, though valid, is printed as inactive because it has an active value of False. The remaining processes are not printed because they are invalid.
