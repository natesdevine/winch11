This screenshot shows the ability of our code to validate the processes from the user's selected file. The process in the first line of the file is rejected because of invalid time format. The processes in the second and third lines are accepted as each parameter is valid and correct, the processes in the fourth and fifth lines are both rejected because of invalid time formatting. Finally, the final two processes are identified as invalid because they are simply blank lines from the text file.
